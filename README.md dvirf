# kehilashon - A Project for Positive Speech

Kehilashon is a social project aimed at helping individuals and communities improve their speaking habits. Through a shared schedule, each participant commits to refraining from speaking gossip or slander for a designated hour.

> "It is very close to you, in your mouth and in your heart to do it." (Deuteronomy 30)
